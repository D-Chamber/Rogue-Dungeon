# OOD Final - Console Based RPG
This was my final project for the Object Oriented Design class. This project was a culmination of 2 months worth of work.

Implemented ideas of different patterns such as:
- Notification Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Abstract Factory
- Decorator Pattern
